`node-gyp` used to bind and compile C++ for NodeJS project. To get it, run:

`npm i -g node-gyp`

In this example `index.js` is using C++ functions with and without callback.

To build a project, use: `npm run install` which will trigger `node-gyp rebuild`.

`index.js` can be easily run with node as `node index.js`

You will be satisfied with native Banana calls
